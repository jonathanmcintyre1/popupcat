DATABASE CHANGES 
--------------------
IMPORTANT: MAKE SURE YOU BACKUP YOUR DATABASE JUST TO BE SAFE. 

You will have to run the following queries into your database. 

You can run those with PhpMyAdmin -> selecting the database -> going to the SQL tab and running the following mysql query.


update settings set value = JSON_SET(value, "$.is_enabled", "1") where `key` = 'payment';
INSERT INTO `settings` (`key`, `value`) VALUES ('license', '{"license": "", "type":""}');


AFTERMATH TO DO
--------------------
1. Login to the Admin Panel
2. Go to the Website Settings -> License Tab
3. Introduce your actual license code that you own and save it
4. Go to Website Settings -> Payment Tab if you need to enable / disable the payment system
