DATABASE CHANGES 
--------------------
IMPORTANT: MAKE SURE YOU BACKUP YOUR DATABASE JUST TO BE SAFE. 

You will have to run the following queries into your database. 

You can run those with PhpMyAdmin -> selecting the database -> going to the SQL tab and running the following mysql query.


ALTER TABLE users_logs DROP user_agent;
ALTER TABLE track_logs DROP user_agent;
ALTER TABLE track_notifications DROP user_agent;
INSERT INTO `settings` (`key`, `value`)
VALUES ('index_url', '');
