DATABASE CHANGES 
--------------------
IMPORTANT: MAKE SURE YOU BACKUP YOUR DATABASE JUST TO BE SAFE. 

You will have to run the following queries into your database. 

You can run those with PhpMyAdmin -> selecting the database -> going to the SQL tab and running the following mysql query.


alter table pages modify type varchar(16) collate utf8_unicode_ci default '' null;
alter table pages modify position varchar(16) default '' not null;
UPDATE pages SET type = LOWER(type);
UPDATE pages SET position = 'top' WHERE position = '1';
UPDATE pages SET position = 'bottom' WHERE position = '0';
