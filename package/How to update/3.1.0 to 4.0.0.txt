1. THE EASIEST WAY
Replace all the folders / files except the "uploads" folder, "install" folder and the "config.php" file.

This is a major update regarding files, all of them have been changed.

You will have to run the following queries into your database. 

You can run those with PhpMyAdmin -> selecting the database -> going to the SQL tab and running the following mysql queries:
