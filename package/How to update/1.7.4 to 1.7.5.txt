DATABASE CHANGES 
--------------------
IMPORTANT: MAKE SURE YOU BACKUP YOUR DATABASE JUST TO BE SAFE. 

You will have to run the following queries into your database. 

You can run those with PhpMyAdmin -> selecting the database -> going to the SQL tab and running the following mysql queries:


1. COPY & RUN THE FOLLOWING QUERIES
--------
alter table packages change is_enabled status tinyint not null;
UPDATE settings SET value = '{\"package_id\":\"custom\",\"name\":\"Custom\",\"status\":1}' WHERE `key` = 'package_custom';
--------

2. Go to the Packages page in the Admin panel and go through the Free and Trial package and make sure to edit it and save it again with the new settings available.
