DATABASE CHANGES 
--------------------
IMPORTANT: MAKE SURE YOU BACKUP YOUR DATABASE JUST TO BE SAFE. 

You will have to run the following queries into your database. 

You can run those with PhpMyAdmin -> selecting the database -> going to the SQL tab and running the following mysql query.


INSERT INTO `settings` (`key`, `value`) VALUES ('register_is_enabled', '1');
INSERT INTO `settings` (`key`, `value`) VALUES ('custom', '{\"custom_js\":\"\",\"custom_css\":\"\"}');
