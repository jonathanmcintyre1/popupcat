DATABASE CHANGES 
--------------------
IMPORTANT: MAKE SURE YOU BACKUP YOUR DATABASE JUST TO BE SAFE. 

You will have to run the following queries into your database. 

You can run those with PhpMyAdmin -> selecting the database -> going to the SQL tab and running the following mysql query.


alter table users add language varchar(32) null after total_notifications_impressions;
alter table users alter column language set default 'english';

INSERT INTO `settings` (`key`, `value`)
VALUES ('business', '{\"invoice_is_enabled\":\"0\",\"name\":\"\",\"address\":\"\",\"city\":\"\",\"county\":\"\",\"zip\":\"\",\"country\":\"\",\"email\":\"\",\"phone\":\"\",\"tax_type\":\"\",\"tax_id\":\"\"}');
